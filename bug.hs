The issue lies in the implementation of the `processTransaction` function. Specifically, the use of `unsafePerformIO` to access the `balance` from the `IORef` is unsafe and can lead to race conditions if multiple threads access the function concurrently. The `modifyIORef` function is also misused; it should update the balance atomically.  The current implementation allows for non-atomic updates, potentially leading to incorrect balances.
